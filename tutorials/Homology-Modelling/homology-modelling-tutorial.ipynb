    "# Homology Modelling Tutorial\n",
    "Max Epstein, Bjarne Feddersen and Phil Biggin (based on previous work from Phill Stansfeld)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will be building an homology model of the human adult muscle nAChR (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor). There are quite a few homology modelling tutorials available online - most of them guide you through a very simple case of a single sequence with a known good alignment to a target with no gaps.   Often though we are not so lucky - this tutorial is designed to take you through a more typical scenario, where you might want to first generate an initial multiple sequence alignment to improve the pair-wise alignment that you will use for the structure generation, what to do about missing bits of the template, how to generate multiple chain models, dealing with disufides, loop refinement and finally how to score and select a good model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general though its also worth thinking about some of the following points before one starts making models:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In what state do we want to model our protein (i.e open, closed or desensitized)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does a structure of a phylogenetically related protein in that particular state exist?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If so, are there multiple structures of this state?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What structure gives the best sequence alignment?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What if you have high sequence alignment but low resolution? Perhaps it's worth considering a different template...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are there any other reasons why you might not want to select a particular structure? I.e. inaccurate assignemnt of EM density - missing loops or regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use this jupyter notebook to explore this.  If you are following the OxCompBio course, then an introduction to python and juypter notebooks is the first session.  If not then you can either work your way through that (found elsewhere in this repo) or see this quick (7 minute) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ952vChhuI introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of this tutorial is that you should be able to follow it through at your own pace.  If you are of a timetabled course, then there will be some demonstrator help available, but this tutorial has been designed such that you should be able to complete it without help, even if you get stuck.\n",
