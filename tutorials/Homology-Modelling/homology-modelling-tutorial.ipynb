    "# Homology Modelling Tutorial\n",
    "Astrid Brandner, Dheeraj Prakaash and Syma Khalid. Based on ealier work by Max Epstein, Bjarne Feddersen, Phil Biggin and Syma Khalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some notes about recent advancements in structure prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Homology modelling has been a very useful technique for many years for obtaining predictions of the three-dimensional structures of proteins based on the sequence similarities/homology with proteins of known structure. In the last 2 years this field of bioinformatics has seen a major revoluation with the advent of the AI driven structure prediction tool; Alpha Fold2 (AF2).\n",
    "\n",
    "AF2 has been shown to be very accurate for the prediction of single domain, single chain, globular proteins. It is currently being extended to improve its capabilities for dealing with membrane proteins, multidomain proteins and oligomeric assemblies. We do not have time to go into this in detail here, but you can read all about it here: https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk . Indeed it now even has a facebook interface which you can have a play around with in your own time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will be building an homology model of the Yersinia Pestis outer membrane protein, OmpA. There are quite a few homology modelling tutorials available online - most of them guide you through a very simple case of a single sequence with a known good alignment to a target with no gaps.   However, often though we are not so fortunate. This tutorial is designed to take you through a more typical scenario, where you may want to first generate an initial multiple sequence alignment to improve the pair-wise alignment that you will use for the structure generation, what to do about missing parts of the template, how to generate multiple domain models, loop refinement and finally how to score and select a good model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general it is also worth thinking about some of the following points before one starts making models:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In what state do we want to model our protein (i.e open, closed or desensitized)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does a structure of a phylogenetically related protein in that particular state exist?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If so, are there multiple structures of this state?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What structure gives the best sequence alignment?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What if you have high sequence alignment but low resolution? Perhaps it's worth considering a different template...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are there any other reasons why you might not want to select a particular structure? I.e. inaccurate assignemnt of EM density - missing loops or regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use this jupyter notebook to explore this.  If you are following the OxCompBio course, then an introduction to python and juypter notebooks is the first session.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of this tutorial is that you should be able to follow it through at your own pace.  If you are of a timetabled course, then there will be some demonstrator help available, but this tutorial has been designed such that you should be able to complete it without help, even if you get stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BEFORE YOU START - Please check if all the programs are installed locally in the desktop you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the linux Virtual Machine and search for a terminal. In the terminal type:\n",
    "- `% jalview --version`\n",
    "- `% pymol -c`\n",
    "- `% mod9.23` \n",
    "\n",
    "Please raise your hand if some command does not work and let a demonstrator help you."
