    "[GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org/) is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. GROMACS is one of the many MD simulation packages, it is free to use and it is what we will be using for the purposes of this tutorial.  Note that this tutorial will only scratch the surface of all the powerful things GROMACS can do and there are many functionalities that we will not cover today.\n",

    "\n",
    "Gromacs supports many different file types, here we give a brief overview of the different file types we will encounter during this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coordinates files have the extension .gro and the default name is conf.gro.\n",
    "- The topology file (default name topol.top) contains all the information about which atoms are bonded to which and what force-field parameters are applied etc.\n",
    "- The trajectory files have the extension .xtc and .trr, the former does not contain velocity information and coordinates are held at a reduced precision, and so occupies less disk space. However you will need velocities if you want to continue a simulation.\n",
    "- The .edr file contains the energy information from the trajectory.\n",
    "- The .mdp file contains the information that was used to setup the actual simulation. Things related to temperature, pressure, how the electrostatics is calculated etc.\n",
    "- The .tpr file is a binary file that contains all the information needed to perform the actual run (this allows gromacs to do lots of self-consistency checks to minimize user errors).\n",

    "\n",
    "As previously discussed in notebook 2, we will use the HIV-1 protease structure (1HSG). It is a homodimer with two chains of 99 residues each.

    "- `% Ctrl + x`, if you used `nano`\n",
    "\n",

    "Now we need to prepare our protein for simulation. First of all we will extract only the protein coordinates from the pdb file into a new file called `protein.pdb`. To do this enter the following command:\n",

    "The program should run and present a list of force-fields from which to select. Select the AMBER99SB-ILDN force field which should be option 6 in the list followed by 1 to select the recommended TIP3P water. If all goes well this should generate several files:\n",

In order for us to use an Ewald method to calculate the electrostatic interactions we need to have a neutral system overall. Therefore we will add counterions (chloride ions, in this case) using the option `-neutral` and enough ions to make the solution up to 150 mM (`-conc 0.15`). This is done by replacing random water molecules (SOL) with NA+ or CL- ions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we can run the actual dynamics, we need to first minimize the energy of the system. This means that we need to allow the structure to relax so that the optimal geometry is obtained and there are no steric clashes between neighbouring atoms. Ideally you would minimize down until the forces were below a certain level (tolerance), but we will just give a quick burst of 200 steps here. Since we have finished setting up the system, we will now move to the `run` directory to perform our simulation from there:\n",
    "\n",
    "`% cd ../run`\n",

    "\n",
    "It is time now to invoke the `mdrun` command, which is the main engine within GROMACS which performs the MD simulation. We cannot run the simulation on the login nodes of ARC; these can only be used to prepare the system for the simulation. Therefore instead of typing the `mdrun` command -that will initiate the energy minimisation- directly on the command line, we will submit a script that will submit the job to the job scheduler. Copy this script to your working directory:\n",

The analysis can be done on the output files that will be generated or you can always use the output data from the simulation that we have already performed, found in the directory `../prerun/run` (This is 1000 ps simulation of the same system).\n",

    "\n",
    "### <span style='color:darkred'> 3.3.4 MD trajectory modification </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "During the simulation, the protein was free to rotate and translate and it is possible that it has diffused out of the box (remember that due to the periodic boundary conditions, the protein could appear to exit from one side of the box while entering from the opposite side). It will be easier to perform certain types of analysis later on, if we now put the protein back at the center of the box and then remove the rotational and translational motion. To this end, we need to modify the simulation trajectory `md.xtc' in three consecutive steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's ensure that no atoms jump across the box and that the protein remains whole, using the `-pbc nojump` flag:\n",
    "\n",
    "`% gmx trjconv -f md.xtc -s md.tpr -pbc nojump -o md_nojump.xtc`\n",

    "`% gmx trjconv -f md_center.xtc -s md.tpr -fit rot+trans -o md_fit.xtc`\n",

    "The `.xtc` files are large in size and since we are only going to need the original trajectory (`md.xtc`) (never delete this!) and the final trajectory (`md_fit.xtc`), we can remove the intermediate trajectories that we generated:\n",

    "\n",
    "After the end of the production run, it would be useful to obtain some properties that will give us an insight into our protein system.\\\n",
    "There are various so-called ensembles that are used for protein simulations - probably the most common is a system where the number of particles, the pressure and the temperature are held constant (NPT). This is usually achieved by employing algorithms that regulate the temperature and pressure, known as thermostats and barostats, respectively. Here, for the regulation of temperature, we use the velocity rescale thermostat, defined in the `md.mdp ` file, which couples the system to a \"heat-bath\" and ensures the reproduction of a correct kinetic ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it is usually a good idea to check these as a function of time through the trajectory just to make sure nothing unexpected happened. First let us check the temperature of our simulation.\n",

    "The program will then present you with a large table of all the values recorded in the energy (.edr) file. We want to examine temperature so type 13, press enter and then 0 and press enter again. The program will then analyse the temperature and present some statistics of the analysis at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another set of properties that is quite useful to examine is the various energetic contributions to the energy. The total energy should be constant. but the various contributions can change and this can sometimes indicate something interesting or strange happening in your simulation. Let us look at some energetic properties of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "`% gmx energy -s md.tpr -f md.edr -o 1hsg_energies.xvg`\n",
