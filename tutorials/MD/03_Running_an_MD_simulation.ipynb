    "[GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org/) is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. GROMACS is one of the many MD simulation packages, it is free to use and it is what we will be using for the purposes of this tutorial.  Note that this tutorial will only scratch the surface of all the powerful things GROMACS can do and there are many functionalities that we will not cover today.\n",
