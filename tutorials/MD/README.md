# Oxford Computational Biochemistry Molecular Dynamics Tutorial

## Contents

The Oxford Computational Biochemistry Molecular Dynamics (MD) tutorial utilises the GROMACS simulation package and describes the steps for setting up, equilibrating and simulating a protein in water. 

The tutorial also makes use of the VMD software for visualisation purposes, Gromacs tools for performing basic analysis and the xmgrace package for plotting.

The `md-prac.html` file contains the detailed instructions required for the tutorial (which have also been handed out to you if you are attending the tutorial in person) and can be opened with a browser by typing on a terminal:
```

firefox md-prac.html
```
The `Introduction_to_MD_2019.pdf` file contains the MD lecture slides.

## Requirements
The following software packages were used: 

   • [GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org/) version 2018.
   
   • [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) version 1.9.2.
   
   • [Grace](http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/doc/UsersGuide.html) version 5.1.25.

If you are attending the Oxford Computational Biochemistry workshop and are using the Linux VM, these have already been installed for you.
