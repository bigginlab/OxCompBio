<h3>Why is docking important?</h3>
<p>The purpose of this practical is to give a flavour of how one could dock small flexible molecules to a protein structure. Such <i>in silico</i> methods are extremely useful for both finding potential binding sites and also to discover and/or engineer new molecules that could bind to a known site. This is a multi-billion dollar industry. Virtual screening and blind docking are often employed in an attempt to discover new medicines.</p>

<h3>A case study: HIV-1 protease</h3>
<p>The HIV-1 protease <a href="#references">[1]</a> is an enzyme that is vital for the replication of HIV. It cleaves newly formed polypeptide chains at appropriate locations so that they form functional proteins. Hence, drugs that target this protein could be vital for suppressing viral replication. A handful of drugs - called HIV-1 protease inhibitors (saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, etc.) <a href="#references">[2]</a> - are currently commercially available that inhibit the function of this protein, by binding in catalytic site that binds the polypeptide.

</p>

<h3>What does this practical cover?</h3>
<p>We will first look at the protein structure (PDB ID: 1HSG) <a href="#references">[3]</a> used in the molecular dynamics practical in a bit more detail. We will then try to dock a couple of drug molecules into the binding site to see how well docking can reproduce the binding pose. If time permits, we will generate the electrostatic surface of the protein to study how the drug interacts with the protein.
</p>

<h3>Make sure the tools work</h3>
<p>
Anything that starts with the symbol <tt>%</tt> should be run in a Linux terminal/command prompt and <tt>PyMOL&gt;</tt> should be run in a PyMOL command line.

<li>In a terminal (open a new terminal if you don't have one open already), change to the docking practical directory.
<pre>
% cd ~/OxCompBio/tutorials/Docking/dock-prac/1HSG
</pre>
<li>Download the protease structure in PDB format (PDB ID: 1HSG) from the Protein Data Bank (<a href="http://www.pdb.org">http://www.pdb.org</a>). Search using the PDB ID 1HSG. On the results page, click <b>Download Files</b> and select <b>PDB File (Text)</b>. Save it in <tt>~/OxCompBio/tutorials/Docking/dock-prac/1HSG</tt>. If the internet is down you can get a copy from <tt>~/OxCompBio/tutorials/Docking/dock-prac/backup/data/1HSG.pdb</tt>.

Make sure you set the filename <b>Name</b> to 1HSG.pdb. Click <b>Save</b>)
<li>Load the structure into <tt>pymol</tt>. You should see the protein structure displayed as lines and water molecules as little red crosses.
<pre>
% pymol 1HSG.pdb &amp;

<li>Lets start by hiding everything. Click the <b>H</b> (for hide) next to <b>all</b> in PyMOL's <b>Object Control Panel</b> (the panel on the right with buttons <b>A</b>ctions, <b>H</b>ide, <b>S</b>how, <b>L</b>abel and <b>C</b>olour) and select <b>everything</b>. The screen should be clear now.
<li>Now show (<b>S</b>) the protein (<b>1HSG</b>) using the <b>cartoon</b> representation and colour (<b>C</b>) by chain to show that it is a homodimer.
<li>Let's select the ligand indinavir and show it as sticks. In the PyMOL command line (with a "<tt>PyMOL &gt;_</tt>") type

<tt>resn MK1</tt> selects the residue MK1, which is indinavir. You should now have an object in the object control panel called <b>(indinavir)</b>. Display it as sticks. Click anywhere in the display screen to unselect the selected atoms.
<li>Now, rotate (left mouse button), zoom (right mouse button) and move (middle mouse button) the molecule to get an idea where the binding site is. You will need to know where it is for the next exercise .

<h2><li><a name="exercise2" id="exercise2">Exercise 2: Preparing the protein and ligand for docking</a></li></h2>
<p>Docking algorithms require each atom to have a charge and an atom type that describes its properties. However, the PDB structure lacks these. So, we have to prep the protein and ligand files to include these values along with the atomic coordinates. Furthermore, for flexible ligand docking, we should also define ligand bonds that are rotatable. All this will be done in a tool called AutoDock Tools (<tt>adt</tt>).</p>

<h3>Prepare the protein</h3> 
<ol type="i" class="roman">
<li>The PDB file (<tt>1HSG.pdb</tt>) contains protein, ligand and water oxygen atoms. First we have to extract just the protein atoms, which are lines that start with the keyword <b>ATOM</b>. Each protein chain is terminated with a line that starts with <b>TER</b>. (If you would like to confirm this, open <tt>1HSG.pdb</tt> in a text editor and scroll through the text.)
<pre>
% egrep "^(ATOM|TER)" 1HSG.pdb > 1HSG_protein.pdb
</pre> 
<li>Lauch AutoDock Tools (ADT) using the command <tt>adt</tt>
<pre>
% adt &amp;
</pre>
<li>Load the protein using <b>File &gt; Read Molecule</b>. Select <tt>1HSG_protein.pdb</tt>. Click <b>Open</b>.<br>
<b>Note:</b> In ADT, you can translate the molecule by clicking and holding down the right mouse button while moving the mouse, rotate by clicking and holding down the middle button and zoom in/out by using the scroll wheel of the mouse.
<li>Bonds and atoms are shown in white. For better visualisation, colour the structure by atom type - <b>Color &gt; By Atom Type</b>. Click <b>All Geometries</b> and then <b>OK</b>. 
<li><div id="question">Q: Can you locate the binding site visually?</div>
<li>Crystal structures normally lack hydrogen atoms. <span id="question">Q: Why?</span> However, hydrogen atoms, or more specifically polar hydrogen atoms are required for appropriate treatment of electrostatics during docking. Add hydrogen atom to the structure using - <b>Edit &gt; Hydrogen &gt; Add</b>. Click <b>OK</b>. You should see a lot of white dashes where the hydrogens were added.
<li>Now we need to get ADT to assign charges and atom type to each atom in the protein. We do this with <b>Grid &gt; Macromolecule &gt; Choose...</b>. Choose <b>1HSG_protein</b> in the popup window and click <b>Select Molecule</b>. ADT will merge non-polar hydrogens, assign charges and prompt you to save the macromolecule. Click <b>Save</b>. This will create a file called <tt>1HSG_protein.pdbqt</tt> in the current folder. Open this in a text editor and look at the last two columns - these should be the charge and atom type for each atom. <div id="question">Q: Look at the charges. Does it make sense?</div>
<li>Now, we need to define the 3D search space were ligand docking will be attempted. Remember the binding site that you observed in one of the earlier steps. Ideally, if we do not know the binding site, we will either define a box that encloses the whole protein or perhaps a specific region of the protein. In this case, to speed up the docking process, we will define a search space that encloses the known binding site.
<li>To define the box, use <b>Grid &gt; Grid Box...</b>. This will draw a box with opposite faces coloured in red, green and blue. Fiddle with the dials and see how you can enclose regions of the protein. In this instance we will use a <b>Spacing (angstrom)</b> of <b>1&Aring;</b> (this is essentially a scaling factor). So set this dial to <b>1.000</b>. So that we all get consistent results, let us set the <b>(x, y, z) center</b> as <b>(16, 25, 4)</b> and the <b>number of points in (x, y, z)-dimension</b> as <b>(30, 30, 30)</b>. Make a note of these values. We will need it later. Close the <b>Grid Options</b> dialog by clicking <b>File &gt; Close w/out saving</b>.
<li>That is all we need to do with the protein file. Delete it from the display using <b>Edit &gt; Delete &gt; Delete Molecule</b> and select <tt>1HSG_protein</tt>. Click <b>Delete Molecule</b>.
</ol>

<h3>Prepare the ligand</h3>
<ol type="i" class="roman">
<li>Like the protein, the ligand lacks hydrogen atoms. We need to add hydrogen atoms and also define rotatable bonds that will be used for flexible docking.
<li>First, extract the ligand atoms from the PDB. As mentioned in Exercise 1, the ligand residue name for <b>indinavir</b> in the PDB file is <b>MK1</b> and the lines start with the keyword <b>HETATM</b> for heteroatoms. In a terminal type
<pre>
% grep "^HETATM.*MK1" 1HSG.pdb &gt; indinavir.pdb
</pre>
<li>Load the ligand structure into ADT using <b>File &gt; Read Molecule</b> and select <tt>indinavir.pdb</tt> 
<li>Again, colour by atom type. <b>Color &gt; By Atom Type</b>. Click <b>All Geometries</b> and then <b>OK</b>.
<li>Now we have to add polar hydrogen atoms. Add all hydrogen atoms initially. Non polar hydrogens will be merged in the next step. <b>Edit &gt; Hydrogens &gt; Add</b>. Select <b>All Hydrogens</b> and click <b>OK</b>.
<li>Define this as the <u>ligand</u> in ADT so that ADT assigns partial charges and sets rotatable ligand bonds using <b>Ligand &gt; Input &gt; Choose...</b>. Select <tt>indinavir</tt> and click <b>Select Molecule for AutoDock4</b>. You should see a message that confirms that non-polar hydrogens have been merged, charges added and rotatable bond detected. Click <b>OK</b>. The ligand will now have only polar hydrogens.
<li>To check the rotatable bonds detected by ADT, go to <b>Ligand &gt; Torsion Tree &gt; Choose Torsions....</b> You should see 14 rotatable bonds.
<li><div id="question">Q: What does the three colours - green, magenta and red  - mean? Does it make sense?</div>
<li>Click <b>Done</b> when you are done.
<li>Save the ligand file in PDBQT format. Do this using <b>Ligand &gt; Output &gt; Save as PDBQT...</b>. Click <b>Save</b> to save the file as <tt>indinavir.pdbqt</tt>.
<li>Quit ADT using <b>File &gt; Exit</b> and then <b>OK</b>.
</ol>

<h3>Prepare a docking configuration file</h3>

<ol type="i" class="roman">
<li>Before we can perform the actual docking, we need to create an input file that defines the protein, ligand and the search parameters. We will create the input file in a text editor.
<li>If you have used Unix/Linux before, open your favourite text editor - <tt>vi</tt>, <tt>emacs</tt>, <tt>nano</tt> - or use a GUI based editor called <tt>gedit</tt>.
<pre>
% gedit &amp;
</pre> 
<li>The input file should look something like:
<pre>
receptor = 1HSG_protein.pdbqt
ligand = indinavir.pdbqt

num_modes = 50

out = all.pdbqt

center_x = XX
center_y = XX
center_z = XX

size_x = XX
size_y = XX
size_z = XX

seed = 2009
</pre>
This defines your protein (<tt>receptor</tt>), ligand, number of docking modes to generate (<tt>num_modes</tt>). All the docked modes will be collated in a file defined by <tt>out</tt> (<tt>all.pdbqt</tt>). You should replace the <b>XX</b> with the center of your 3D search space (<tt>center_x/y/z</tt>) and the size of the box (<tt>size_x/y/z</tt>) that you defined in the "Prepare the protein" section.
<li>Save the file as <tt>config.txt</tt> in the folder containing the protein and ligand <tt>.pdbqt</tt> files.
</ol>
<br>

<h2><li><a name="exercise3" id="exercise3">Exercise 3: Docking indinavir into HIV-1 protease</a></li></h2>
<ol type="i" class="roman">
<li>For this practical, we will use a program called <b>Autodock Vina</b> <a href="#references">[4]</a> for docking. Autodock Vina is a fast docking alogorithm that requires minimal user intervention. We will run it from a terminal.
<li>Make sure you are in the folder containing <tt>1HSG_protein.pdbqt</tt>, <tt>indinavir.pdbqt</tt> and <tt>config.txt</tt>
<li>Run <tt>vina</tt> to perform the docking. We will keep a log of all the program output in a file <tt>log.txt</tt>
<pre>
% vina --config config.txt --log log.txt
</pre>
This will take a few minutes depending on how fast your computer is. While you wait, if you are interested, read  <a href="#references">[1]</a> for a review on HIV-1 protease structure, function and drug discovery.
<li>Once the run is complete, you should have a two files <tt>all.pdbqt</tt>, which contains all the docked modes, and <tt>log.txt</tt>, which contains a table of calculated affinities based on AutoDock Vina's scoring function <a href="#references">[4]</a>. The best docked mode, according to AutoDock Vina, is the first entry in <tt>all.pdbqt</tt>.
<li>Lets visualise the docks and compare it to the crystal conformation of the ligand. Load the protein, the extracted ligand and the docks into <tt>pymol</tt>.
<pre>
% pymol 1HSG_protein.pdb indinavir.pdb all.pdbqt &amp;
</pre>
<li>Begin by hiding everything. Now, display the <b>protein</b> in <b>cartoon</b> representation, <b>indinavir</b> in <b>stick</b> representation and the <b>docked conformations</b> as <b>sticks</b> as well.
<li>Cycle through the docks by clicking the playback control buttons on the lower right hand corner of the window.
<li><div id="question">Q: Qualitatively, how good are the docks?</div>
<li><div id="question">Q: Is the crystal binding mode reproduced? If not or if there is a difference, what could be the reason? Is it the best  conformation according to AutoDock Vina?</div>
<li>Close PyMOL.

<h2><li><a name="exercise4" id="exercise4">Exercise 4: Docking nelfinavir into HIV-1 protease</a></li></h2>
<ol type="i" class="roman">
<li>In the previous exercise, AutoDock Vina should have found a near native docked conformation for the drug <b>indinavir</b>. In this exercise, we will try to dock another drug <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelfinavir" taret="new"><b>nelfinavir</b></a> into the protein structure 1HSG broadly along the lines of how one would dock a small molecule into a target structure.

The HIV-1 protease cleaves the peptide bond of newly formed polypeptide chains at specific recognition sites.

<h2><li><a name="discussion" id="discussion">Concluding remarks</a></li></h2>
In this practical, we have looked at how small molecules could be docked into a protein. This approach is widely used to detect binding sites and also to screen a library of small molecules to find potential drugs that could bind to a known binding site. Scoring functions play an important role in identifying a "good dock" and as such remains an area of active research. Several other considerations are worth noting including water molecules and ions in the binding site, flexibility of binding site residues, etc. Some docking programs (including AutoDock Vina) allow you to define a subset of flexible sidechains. Whilst this permits binding site rearrangement to accommodate distinct ligands, the computational search space increases many fold. Defining water molecules that are important in the binding site also remains an area of active research. In this practical, we have considered only protein-ligand docking. Protein-protein docking is also widely used, but not considered here due to the significantly higher search space that has to be considered. As the number of published and unpublished protein structures continue to grow, <i>in silico</i> docking will continue to play an important role in the drug discovery process.
