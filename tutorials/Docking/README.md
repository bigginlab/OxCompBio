# Oxford Computational Biochemistry Docking Tutorial

## Contents

This tutorial teaches the basics of molecular docking.

Here we dock small molecules indinavir and nelfinavir into HIV-1 protease.

## Requirements

The following software installations are required to do this workshop:

For system preparation:
- [AutodockTools](http://autodock.scripps.edu/resources/adt)

For the molecular docking calculations:
- [Autodock Vina](http://vina.scripps.edu/)

For analysis and visualisation:
- [Pymol](https://pymol.org/2/)

## Getting started

Please see docking-2019.pdf (a html file is also provided) for the tutorial instructions.

All calculations should be done under the `1HSG`, `1HSG_nefinavir` and `1HSG_APBS` folders found under `dock-prac`.

Backup data files can be found under `dock-prac/backup`.
