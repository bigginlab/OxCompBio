# Oxford Computational Biochemistry Docking Tutorial

## Contents

This tutorial teaches the basics of molecular docking.

Here we dock small molecules indinavir and nelfinavir into HIV-1 protease.

## Getting started

Please see [https://bigginlab.github.io/OxCompBio/docking.html](https://bigginlab.github.io/OxCompBio/docking.html) for the tutorial instructions, including installation instructions for the software below.

In order to set everything up before the tutorial, you need to complete the following sections:

2. Installing the packages locally
3. Obtaining the data files and checking it all works

The actual tutorial starts at section 4.

### Requirements

The following software installations are required to do this workshop:

For the molecular docking calculations:
- [Autodock Vina](http://vina.scripps.edu/)

For analysis and visualisation:
- [Pymol](https://pymol.org/2/)

For system preparation:
- [ADFR](https://ccsb.scripps.edu/adfr/downloads/)
