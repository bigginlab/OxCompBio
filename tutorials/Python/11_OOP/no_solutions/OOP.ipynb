Achieving this functionality with the simple dictionary defined above would have been more complicated and error prone."

    "In this section we have introduced a lot \"basic\" principles and definitions of object oriented programming and hopefully you are now convinced of how powerful and clean this programming paradigm is. We made extensive use of the `.` operators, which indicates you are using an object and accessing its data (attributes) or associated functionality (methods). The key points to take away from this lesson are the following:"
