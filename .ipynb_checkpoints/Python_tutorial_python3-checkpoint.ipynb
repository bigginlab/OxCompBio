    "A word of caution: don't get in the habit of using triple quotes for strings, as these should be reserved for docstrings. As previously mentioned, it is not necessary to know exactly what these are, just know that these are important in other aspect of Python, and it wouldn't be a good idea to mix them with single and double quotation marks."
