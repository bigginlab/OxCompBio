# Oxford Computational Biochemistry course

This repository contains the teaching materials for the Oxford Computational Biochemistry course.
This two and half day course is aimed at graduate students who have had no prior experience in the area of Computational Biochemistry. It assumes no prior knowledge and only tries to cover basic concepts.

## Tutorials

### 1) Molecular Dynamics

### 2) Python [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bigginlab/WTcourse/master)

A set of jupyter notebooks which aim to teach the basics of python programming assuming no prior knowledge.
First introducing core concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals and lists, we eventually demonstrate how Molecular Dynamics simulations can be analysed using python libraries such as [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/) and [NGLView](http://nglviewer.org/nglview/latest/).

### 3) Homology Modelling

### 4) Molecular Docking
